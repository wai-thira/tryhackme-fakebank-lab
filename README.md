# TryHackMe – FakeBank Lab

This repository documents my learning from the TryHackMe "FakeBank" lab.

The lab demonstrated how insecure web application logic can be abused
to perform unauthorized actions such as withdrawing funds.

The purpose of this documentation is to show understanding of
basic web vulnerabilities and secure coding concepts.
