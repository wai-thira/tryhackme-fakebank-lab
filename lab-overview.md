# Lab Overview – FakeBank

The FakeBank lab simulates a vulnerable online banking web application.

The objective of the lab was to explore how poor access control
and insecure application logic can allow users to perform actions
they are not authorized to do.

This lab focused on understanding the vulnerability rather than
writing exploit code.
